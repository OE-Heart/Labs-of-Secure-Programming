# **Lab 1.1** Web Environment Setup-Java/Tomcat/Eclipse

## Overview

Web programming is a really big topic, which is  related to a series of work. But In this lab, the only thing you have to do is: learn how to setup the web environment, include Java, Tomcat and Eclipse. It is the very base of all our further work about Web. 

Before you start, you should choose the OS platform  first, windows or linux. Actually, both platforms are suitable, just up  to you! 

Back to the lab, what’s our objective:

1. Setup the Java, and make sure  it’s correct.
2. Setup the tomcat, and check the  tomcat welcome page.
3. Setup the Eclipse, and learn  how to use it.

## For Linux

If you choose linux as your OS platform, maybe a virtual machine with Ubuntu Linux OS in VMWare/VirtualBox is the most suitable way for your  lab.

VMWare/VirtualBox is software that enables users to  easily create and run virtual machines on a Windows or Linux PC. For  additional information you can refer to the Internet.                  

Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating system, with Unity as its default desktop environment (GNOME was the previous  desktop environment). It is based on free software. According to some  metrics, Ubuntu is the most popular desktop Linux distribution. 

## Steps(**For Windows**)

1. Setup the Java.
   - Download the Java,[ links](http://www.java.com/zh_CN/);
   - Run the Java Installer and check the Java version.

2. Setup the Tomcat:
   - Download the Tomcat,[ links](http://tomcat.apache.org/);
   - Run the Tomcat Installer.

3. Setup the Eclipse:
   - Download the Eclipse,[ links](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/);
   - Run the Tomcat Installer;
   - Learn how to use Eclipse and Develop a "Hello World"!

## Deliverables

When you finish the lab, the last thing you have to do  is writing the lab report. Luckily, in this lab, you don't have to  submit you report alone, but present the report with lab 1.2 together  (see details of lab 1.2 for deadline). So the remaining things you have  to do are: 1. Record the lab procedure and other things you want to  mention; 2. Take some screen shots which are necessary to prove what you have done.

# Lab 1.2 Implementation of Web Application

## Overview

In lab 1.1, you have learned to setup the Web  Programming Environment. It is easy, but very important, which is the  base of lab 1.2.

In this lab, you will learn how to implement a web  application. Usually, a web application is related with database, web  server, data access, service, page design and so on. So there are really much you have to learn before you start the Implementation.                  

Back to the lab, what's our objective: 

1. Design and access the database  (MySQL recommended).
2. Learn to use web server and  deploy your web application (Tomcat recommended).
3. Implement the application (Html,  JSP recommended).
4. CSS is required to be used for controlling  the page display in the “External Style Sheet” way.

## Steps

To develop a web application, there usually  some steps you should follow:

1. Design you application well.  (It is very theoretical but  necessary. A good design can save you much work; on  the other hand, a  not very well design will really bother you in the later   implementation.)
2. Design the database, and the  data access mode.
3. Implement the application,  include web pages, service and others.
4. Deploy your web application and  test it.

## Deliverables

When you finish lab1.2, you have to write  the lab report and submit your **report** and **source code** on the Learning in ZJU platform. In the part of lab1.2, some  contents are require:

1. Descript your application scenarios  to make the TA know what you want to do.
2. How is your application  designed.
3. The database design.
4. The procedure of implementation.
5. The deploy process and the test.

Actually, what we want to know is the  procedure how you design and  implement your web application. To prove this, I think  tables, charts  and screen shots are good ways for you to descript you self. 
  The report should be a pdf document named  with “**SP2021-LAB1.1&1.2-ID-NAME**”. Finally, just send it to TA before **2021.6.6 23:59:59**.
