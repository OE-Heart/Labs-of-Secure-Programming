# **Lab 1.1** Web Environment Setup-Java/Tomcat/Eclipse

## Overview

Web programming is a really big topic, which is  related to a series of work. But In this lab, the only thing you have to do is: learn how to setup the web environment, include Java, Tomcat and Eclipse. It is the very base of all our further work about Web. 

Before you start, you should choose the OS platform  first, windows or linux. Actually, both platforms are suitable, just up  to you! 

Back to the lab, what’s our objective:

1. Setup the Java, and make sure  it’s correct.
2. Setup the tomcat, and check the  tomcat welcome page.
3. Setup the Eclipse, and learn  how to use it.

### For Linux

If you choose linux as your OS platform, maybe a virtual machine with Ubuntu Linux OS in VMWare/VirtualBox is the most suitable way for your  lab.

VMWare/VirtualBox is software that enables users to  easily create and run virtual machines on a Windows or Linux PC. For  additional information you can refer to the Internet.                  

Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating system, with Unity as its default desktop environment (GNOME was the previous  desktop environment). It is based on free software. According to some  metrics, Ubuntu is the most popular desktop Linux distribution. 

### Steps(**For Windows**)

1. Setup the Java.
   - Download the Java,[ links](http://www.java.com/zh_CN/);
   - Run the Java Installer and check the Java version.

2. Setup the Tomcat:
   - Download the Tomcat,[ links](http://tomcat.apache.org/);
   - Run the Tomcat Installer.

3. Setup the Eclipse:
   - Download the Eclipse,[ links](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/);
   - Run the Tomcat Installer;
   - Learn how to use Eclipse and Develop a "Hello World"!

## Deliverables

When you finish the lab, the last thing you have to do  is writing the lab report. Luckily, in this lab, you don't have to  submit you report alone, but present the report with lab 1.2 together  (see details of lab 1.2 for deadline). So the remaining things you have  to do are: 1. Record the lab procedure and other things you want to  mention; 2. Take some screen shots which are necessary to prove what you have done.
